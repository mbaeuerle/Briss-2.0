# Briss 2.0 
![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/mbaeuerle/Briss-2.0/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Gradle/badge.svg?branch=master)

Briss is a small application to crop PDF files. It is useful for example to crop whitespaces at the edeges so text is rendered bigger on small screens like eInk displays or tablet PCs.

It helps the user to decide what should be cropped by creating an overlay of similar pages, e.g. all pages within a PDF
 having the same size or orientation. Even and odd pages are separated too.

Version 2.0 is intended to be a GUI Update for the Briss PDF cropping tool.
It is based on Briss 0.9 which is located at sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/briss/
Note that version 2.0 in this repository is developed independently of the original author of 0.9.

Briss is running on Windows, MacOS and Linux and works with Java 8 and above.

## Installation

Currently Briss 2.0 is in alpha therefore some features are still missing.
If you want to give it a try you can download the pre release from https://github.com/mbaeuerle/Briss-2.0/releases.
Starting with v2.0-alpha-5 the whole application including the dependencies is bundled in one Java jar file.

## Usage
You can run the application by double-clicking on `./lib/Briss-2.0-all.jar` or executing the following command in terminal:

```
./bin/Briss-2.0
```
or
```
./bin/Briss-2.0 cropthis.pdf
```

## Commandline

If you prefer command line and trust the basic automatic detection algorithm
use it this way:

```
./bin/Briss-2.0 -s [SOURCEFILE] [-d [DESTINATIONFILE]]
```
Example:
```
./bin/Briss-2.0 -s dogeatdog.pdf -d dogcrop.pdf
./bin/Briss-2.0 -s dogeatdog.pdf
```
the second line will create the cropped pdf into `dogeatdog_cropped.pdf`

To split according to columns/rows, respectively use the `--split-col` and `--split-row` arguments. For example:
```
./bin/Briss-2.0 -s dogeatdog.pdf -d dogcrop.pdf --split-col
```

Splitting columns will try to split the pdf into two columns. Splitting rows will try to split the pdf into two parts
by cutting pages in half.

## Improvements done in Briss 2.0
